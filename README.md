Password Generator

Using Javascipt, HTML, and CSS this page creates a randomly generated password. When clicking "Generate Password" the user is prompted for how many characters they would like with a limit of 8-128. After entering the amount, another prompt notifies the user of their password length. They are then prompted for character parameters including "uppercase", "lowercase", "number", and "special characters". If they select none, a prompt will instruct them to pick at least one and reprompts the previous parameters for the password. 
When the user has selected the parameters they wanted, the password generator will create a random password in the text box that fit the length and other character choices they wanted.
